# Traumatic Brain Injury Project 
Traumatic brain injury effects millions of Americans each year. In addition to the immediate injury concerns, patients afflicted with a TBI have the potential for long term debilitating damage. Although a good amount of research and understanding has been established regarding the moment of impact and tissue damage therein, many modeling efforts have not addressed patient physiology beyond the milisecond time scale. Due to recent breakthroughs in TBI recovery understanding, it is becoming more and more clear that therapuetic interventions over the course of days to weeks may create significant long term positive outcomes in a patients recovery. We seek to create a mathematical model that is able to simulate the patient's angiogensis over these time scales. We explore the role that protein interactions have on global microvascular growth and overall restoration of blood flow to the damaged tissue region.

## Technical Details

The TBI project is written and built in C++ and may be run in a windows environment. Output files will generate all data used in any upcoming publication

## Accessing the Game
The pre-built Alpha game is available in the releases tab. Navigate to that window in github ([here](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/BurnCare/releases)).
To run the game download the zip file, unzip the windowsBurnCare.zip file, and navigate to the following folder: 

- `WindowsNoEditor/`
   - `Game/` 
     - `Binaries/` 
  	   - `Win64/` 
	
From this folder double click (or run) the executable titled Game-Win64-Shipping.exe. This should boot the game. If you have issues please contact: abaird@ara.com.
